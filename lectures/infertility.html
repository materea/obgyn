            <p>Infertility  can  be  defined  as  inability  to  establish  a  pregnancy  within  a  specified  time,  usually  one  year,  in  a  couple  having  regular  unprotected  sexual  intercourse.  There  has  been  a  renewed  interest  in  infertility  and  reproductive  health  failure  in  Subsaharan  Africa  inspite  of  its  high  fertility.  </p>
            <p>In  the  African  culture,  for  an  infertile  couple,  the  society  views  infertility  as  a  social  stigma  with  considerable  emotional  stress.  Family  and  societal  pressure  on  the  infertile  couple  often  predispose  to  marital  stress  and  instability,  polygamy,  divorce,  prostitution  and  in  extreme  cases,  suicidal  tendencies.</p>
            <p>The  aims  of  infertility  management  will  include  a  thorough  investigation,  treatment  of  causes,  sexuality  education  and  counselling,  prognosticate  on  the  chances  of  success  and  provide  emotional  support  for  the  couple.</p>

                   <h4>Primary Infertility  </h4>
                    <p>    Failure  to  conceive  after  one  year  of  unprotected  cohabitation  in  a  woman  who  had  never  conceived  previously.</p>

                   <h4>Secondary Inferility     </h4>
                   <p>    Failure  to  conceive  after  a  year  of  unprotected  cohabitation  in  a  woman  who  had  previously  been  pregnant.  If  the  woman  had  previously  breastfed  her  infant,  then  exposure  to  pregnancy  should  be  calculated  from  the  end  of  the  lactational  amenorrhoea  period.</p>

                   <h4>Pregnancy Wastage</h4>
                   <p>    The  woman  is  able  to  conceive  but  unable  to  produce  a  live-born.</p>
                   
                   <h4>Unproven Fertility/Infertility</h4>
                   <p>    This  refers  to  problems  sometimes  perceived  or  designated  by  couples  as  infertility  in  demographic  surveys,  when  in  fact,  the  woman  is  virtually  not  at  risk  of  conception.  The  problem  may  be  biological (Lactational amenorrhoea - Anovulation),  or  among  couples  practising  contraception,  or  abstinence  when  the  consort  is  away.</p>

                   <h4>Sterility</h4>
                   <p>This  is  complete  and  permanent  inability  to  either  impregnate  or  conceive.  Individuals  with  congenital  absence  of  reproductive  organs  or  who  have  been  sterilized  qualify  for  such  a  designation.</p>

            <a aria-hidden='true' href='#header-2'>Incidence </a>
          </h2>
        </header>
        <div class='body'>
            <p>   It is a worldwide problem affecting approximately  10-15%  of  couples.  Global  variations  have  been  reported  in  the  incidence  of  infertility  from  as  low  as  1%  to  1.5%   in  Korea  and  Thialand  to  as  high  as  13% - 23%  in  urban  areas  of  Columbia  and  rural  areas  of  New  Guinea. </p>
            <p>    The  prevalence  of  infertility  is  particularly  high  in  Subsaharan  Africa,  varying  from  20-46%  in  some  parts  of  West  Africa.  Countries  like  Gabon,  Cameroon,  Guinea  Equatoria,  Central  African  Republic,  Niger,  Mali  and  Zaire  have  levels  of  infertility  among  women  aged  25 - 29 years  ranging  between  7-50%.  This  high  level  of  infertility  suggests  that  acquired  causes  of  infertility  are  prevalent  in  these  countries.  There  are  also  ethnic  and  religious  bias  in  the  prevalence  rates  of  infertility  as  seen  in  these  countries.</p>
            <p>    A  WHO  multicentre  study  showed  that  Africa  was  the  only  region  where  majority  of  couples  had  secondary  infertility.  In  developed  countries,  the  level  of  primary  versus  secondary  infertility  was  71%  and  29%  respectively  while  comparative  figure  for  Africa  was  48%  and  52%  respectively.  Asia,  Latin  America  and  East  Mediterranean  had  levels  of  primary  infertility  higher  than  secondary  infertility.  The  same  study  demonstrates  that  64%  of  females  patients  in  African  centres  as  against  38%  of  patients  in  other  areas  of  the  world  had  post-infectious  infertility. </p>
            <p>In  Africa,  up  to  65%  of  gynaecological  consultations  are  for  infertility. At  the  University  of  Ilorin  Teaching  Hospital,  Ilorin,  more  than  50%  of  gynaecological  consultations  are  for  infertility 6.  Post â€“infectious  infertility  are  relatively  commoner  in  East  and  Central  African  countries  than  the  West  and  South  African  countries. </p>
            <p>    It  is  estimated  that  by  six  months  of  regular  unprotected  intercourse,  60%  of  married  couples  are  expected  to  achieve  pregnancy.  By  12  months,  up  to  90%  would  have  achieved  pregnancy  and  at  the  end  of  18-24  months,  up  to  95%  would  have  achieved  pregnancy.  Younger  women(<18 years)  and  older  women  (>35 years)  do  not  have  maximal  fertility  potential  like  those  between  the  ages  of  18-35  years.  </p>
            <p>The  need  to  investigate  will  therefore  be  predicated  on  the  urgent  desire  to  have  children  by  both  partners,  the  age  of  the  female  partner  especially  if  she  is  over  30 years  as  fertility  declines  with  increasing  age  after  30 years  and  if  there  are  certain  medical  problems  that  may  impair  fertility.</p>

          </h2>
        </header>
        <div class='body'>
            <p>    Apart  from  age,  marital  and  ethnic  factors  highlighted  above,  other  predisposing  factors  include</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Sociocultural  Factors</li>
                <li>Economic  Factors</li>
                <li>Psychological  Factors</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Sociocultural  Factors</h4>
            <p>     Cultural  practices  such  as  age  of  marriage,  type  of  marriage (monogamy/polygamy),  frequency  of  intercourse  and  marriage  stability  have  profound  effects  on  fertility.  Dowry,  female  circumcision,  pregnancy  care  and  traditional  methods  of  delivery  are  plausible  variables  underlying  infertility.</p>
            <h4>Economic  Factors</h4>
            <p>    Micro  and  macro  economic  variables  have  profound  effect  on  fertility  potential  of  the  whole  population  as  was  witnessed  during  the  severe  structural  adjustment  programmes (SAP)  in  Nigeria  between  1985  and  1995  when  the  fertility  was  down  to  about  5.8  from  about  7.0  the  previous  decade. </p>
            <p>Degree   of  urbanization,  education,  industrialization  and  available  basic  health  care  facilities  are  some  other  indices  which  affect  fertility.  War,  famine  and  catastrophes  have  been  shown  to  reduce  fertility  rate  as  shown  by  the  World  Wars,  Bosnian  and  Congolese  experience.  </p>
            <p>    Certain  occupations  and  labour  migration  increase  the  risk  to  sexually  transmitted  diseases (STDs)  including  HIV/AIDS.  Lbour  migration  also  separates  husband  and  wife  hence  reduces  exposure  of  the  wife.</p>
            <h4>Psychological  Factors</h4>
            <p>    Emotional  tensions  have  been  known  to  contribute  significantly  to  the  functional  capability  of  the  hypothalamo-pituitary-ovarian  axis,  or  by  causing  tubal  spasms,  vaginismus,  dyspareunia,  frigidity  and  decreased  male  libido.  Infertility  can  thus  directly  cause  emotional  stress  thus  initiating  a  vicious  cycle.  Investigations  and  treatment  options  in  infertile  couples  could  also  contribute  to  their  emotional  stress.  </p>
            <p>Counselling  and  empathy  are  important  prerequisites  in  assisting   infertile  couples.  The  high  premium  placed  on  children  in  African  cultures  have  also  contributed,  in  no  small  way,  to  this  profound  psychological  stress  associated  with  infertility. </p>

        <div class='body'>
            <p>    Post-infectious  infertility  is  commonest  in  Africa  than  all  other  regions  of  the  world.  In  the  developed  world,  infections  play  less  role  while  hormonal,  congenital  and  psychological  factors  are  important  causative  factors.</p>
            <p>    In  general,  10-15%  is  caused  by  ovulation  disturbances,  30-40%  caused  by  pelvic  factors,  30-40%  is  associated  with  abnormalities  in  the  males,  and  10-15%  associated  with  abnormalities  in  the  cervix.  In  about  10%  of  couples,   with  the  current  techniques  of  investigations,  it  is  impossible  to  diagnose  the  cause  of  infertility,  hence   unexplained  infertility.</p>

                    <h4>Tubal  Factor  </h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>    The  tubal  factor  is  the  commonest  cause  of  infertility  in  the  female.  Tubal  abnormalities,  present  in  50-70%  of  infertile  women,  are  due  to  previous  pelvic  inflammatory  disease.  The  sequale  of  such  inflammatory  process  is  chronic  PID,  tubal  blockage,  hydrosalpinges  and  peri-adnexal  adhesions.  </li>
                        <li>The  PID  is  usually  caused  by  STDs  with  N.gonorrhoea, C. trachomatis  and  T. mycoplasma (Ureaplasma  Urealyticum)  being  the  common  pathogens.  Postpartum  and  postabortal  infections  are  also  important  causes  of  PID.  </li>
                        <li>Less  common  causes  include  infection  of  IUDs,  post  surgical  conditions (appendicitis,  diverticulitis),  tuberculosis,  schistosomiasis  and  pelvic  surgery.  </li>
                        <li>Endometriosis  is  a  rarer  cause  of  tubal  obstruction  in  our  environment.</li>
                        <li>Psychosomatic  factors  has  been  implicated  in  tubal  dysfunction  while  congenital  tubal  aplasia  or  presence  of  convoluted  tubes  are  extremely  rare  causes  of  female  tubal  infertility.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h4>Ovulation  Factor</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>    10-15%  of  female  infertility  is  caused  by  anovulation  and  luteal  phase  defficiency  in  this  environment.  </li>
                        <li>Polycystic  ovarian  disease (Stein-Leventhal  Syndrome)  is  characterized  by  enlarged  ovaries  with  multiple  follicular  cysts,  menstrual  irregularities,  hirsutism,  obesity  and  some  insulin  resistance.  </li>
                        <li>Other  anovulatory  causes  include      </li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>hypothalamic  dysfunction  of  environmental,  physical  or  emotional origin   pituitary  adenomas  with  or  without  hyperprolactinomas  and  </li>
                            <li>hypogonadism  with  or  without  luteal  phase  deficiency.  </li>
                        </ul>
                        <li>Rarer  causes  include  pituitary  hypofunction (sheeanâ€™s  syndrome),  primary  ovarian  failure  e.g  Turnerâ€™s  syndrome,  ovarian  resistant  syndrome  and  contraceptives (oral,  injectables  and  norplant).  </li>
                        <li>An  uncommon  cause  of  anovulation  is  luteinised  unruptured  follicle  syndrome  in  which  there  is  failure  of  ovulation  due  to  intrinsic  defect  in  the  epithelial  surface  of  the  ovary  to  permit  ovulation.  </li>
                        <li> Hormone  production  and  endometrial  luteal  phase  development  are  satisfactory  but  there  is  failure  of  ovulation.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h4>Uterine  Factors  </h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>    Common  uterine  factors  such  as  uterine  fibroids  and  uterine  polyps  are  often  associated  with  infertility  or  reproductive  wastage.  They  cause  distortion  of  the  uterus  and  fallopian  tubes  leading  to  infertility.  </li>
                        <li>Postpartum,  post-abortal,  post-surgical  or  post-tuberculous  endometritis  may  cause  intrauterine  adhesions (uterine  synechiae).  </li>
                        <li>Insufficient  decidual  layer  formation  with  lack  of  or  improper  implantation  may  result  from  luteal  phase  defficiency.  </li>
                    </ul>
                    <h4>Cervical  Factors</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>    Cervical  factors  resulting  in  infertility  include  hormonal  imbalance  which  causes  poor  quality  cervical  mucus  impenetrable  to  the  sperm,  cervical  infections  with  sperm  antibodies,  cervical  stenosis  due  to  congenital  defect  or  previous  cervical  surgery (cauterization  or  cone  biopsy).  </li>
                        <li>The  role  of  immunological  factors  in  cervical  infertility  in  which  women  develop  antisperm  antibodies  has  received  considerable  attention  in  the  last  two  decades  as  a  common  cause  of  hitherto  unexplained  infertility.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h4>Vaginal  Factors</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>    Congenital  or  developmental  defects  such  as  transverse  or  longitudinal  septa,  imperforate  hymen  or  stenosed  fourchette  can  contribute  to  infertility.  </li>
                        <li>Severe  vaginitis  causing  dyspareunia  or  vaginal  stenosis  following  chemical  vaginitis  are  known  though  rare  causes  of  infertility.</li>

                    <li>Subacute  or  chronic  infection  of  the  male  genital  tract  is  a  common  cause  of  poor  sperm  production  or  function.  </li>
                    <li>Common  organisms  implicated  include  </li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Bacteria (gonococcal, coliform, staphylococcal),  </li>
                        <li>Viral (mumps  orchitis, infectious  mononucleosis),  </li>
                        <li>Parasitic (schistosomiasis, toxoplasmosis).  </li>

                    <li>Chromosomal  abnormalities (47XXY/46XX)  can  cause  disorders  in  sperm  production  and  function.  Addictive  behaviours  such  as  alcoholism  and  heavy  smoking  play  a  part  in  lowering  sperm  function  in  men.  </li>
                    <li>Environmental  factors (heavy  metals,  excessive  heat,  radioactivity)  and  chronic  stress  can  reduce  sperm  function.  </li>

            <a aria-hidden='true' href='#header-5'>Clinical  Approach  To  The  Management  Of  The  Infertile  Couple </a>
          </h2>
        </header>
        <div class='body'>
            <p>    To  the  average  medical  practitioner  in  Africa,  it  is  usual  to  see  the  woman  present  first  for  infertility.  It  is  a  cultural  belief  that  the  is  to  blame  for  the  infertility  in  the  couple.  Though  it  is  preferable  to  see  both  partners  at  the  first  visit,  often  this  is  not  practicable  hence  it  is  reasonable  to  commence  with  the  clinical  evaluation  of  the  wife.  Usually,  through  a  combination  of  tact,  patience  and  proper  counselling,  it  is  not  too  difficult  to  elicit  the  support  and  presence  of  the  male  partner.</p>
            <p>    A  detailed  history  should  be  methodological  and  complete  taking  special  note  of  duration  and  severity  of  the  problem,  sexual  history,  history  of  previous  treatments (orthodox and  traditional),  history  of  previous  abdominal  and  pelvic  infections,  history  of  abdominal  and  pelvic  surgeries (including  pregnancy  termination).  Complete  obstetric  history  should  be  taken  while  type  of  profession  and  or  occupation  of  both  partners,  socioeconomic  conditions,  cultural  and  religious  background  of  the  couple  should  be  clarified  e.g  Oligo-asthenospermia  is  relatively  frequent  in  long  distance  professional  drivers.  </p>
            <p>Polygamy/polygny  is  common  in  African  societies  especially  among  muslims  while  workers  on  shift  duties  may  find  it  difficult  to  also  meet  up  with  a  â€˜timedâ€™  intercourse.  </p>
            <p>A  detailed  history  of  past  medical  history  could  unearth  antecedent  or  coincidental  medical  conditions  such  as  diabetes  mellitus,  hypothyroidism,  chronic  granulomatous  diseases  etc  which  may  impair  fertility.</p>
            <p>    A  complete  and  detailed  physical  examination  of  the  couple  is  essential.  </p>

                   <p>    Ideally,  the  couple  need  to  be  investigated  together.  Since  it  is  known  that  in  African  settings,   in  30 â€“ 40%  of  infertile  couples,  both  husband  and  wife  have  discernible  problems.  Proper  counselling  on  the  need  for  these  investigations  should  be  offered.  </p>
                   <p>Efforts  should  be  made  not  to  over  or  under  prognosticate  the  chances  of  the  couple.  Where  it  may  not  be  possible  to  start  with  the  couple  together,  the  woman  can  start  her  own  investigations  pending  the  time  the  husband  could  be  invited  and  investigated.</p>
                   <p>    Investigation  of  the  infertile  couple  should  start  with  general  investigations  such  as  haemogrammes (including  ESR),  urethral,  cervical  or  high  vaginal  swab,  urinalysis,  urine  culture  and  sensitivity.</p>
                   <ul>
                    <li>Semen  analysis </li>
                    <li>Hormonal  evaluation</li>
                    <li>Special  sperm  function  tests</li>

                    <li>Tests  of  tubal  patency</li>
                   </ul>

                   <h4>Semen  Analysis </h4>
                   <p>    Semen  analysis  is  the  specific  investigation  for  male  infertility  and  should  be  done  early.  It  should  be  stressed  that  2-3  tests  should  be  done  at  least  1 month  interval  before  a  conclusion  could  be  reached  as  to  the  normality  of  the  test  especially  if  a  subnormal  result  was  obtained.</p>
                   <p>    The  semen  sample  is  normally  obtained  after  3-5  days  of  abstention. The  sample  obtained  by  masturbation  is  better  for  analysis  than  that  obtained  by  withdrawal  method  or  with  the  aid  of  condoms  as  these  contain  spermicides.    </p>
                   <p>The sample  is  collected  in  a  sterile  wide  mouthed  container  and  should  be  sent  to  the  laboratory  within  2 hours.  Parameters  such  as  volume,  colour,  pH  value,  consistency,  spermatozoal  count  per  ml,  motility  and  morphology  of  spermatozoa  and  fructose  contents  are  examined.  </p>
                   <p>The  sperm  sample  could  also  be  cultured  for  microorganisms  when  indicated  and  the  sensitivity  pattern  to  antimicrobials  shown.</p>
                   <p>    The  computer-assisted  semen  analysis (CASA)  systems  couple  video  technology  and  sophisticated  microcomputers  for  automatic  image  digitalization  and  processing.  This  technology  was  developed  for  more  objective  assessment  of  seminal  parameters  over  the  subjective  measurements  of  standard  semen  analysis.  CASA  permits  the  measurements  of  additional  motility  parameters  such  as  curvilinear  velocity,  straight  line  velocity,  linear  and  flagellar  beat  frequency.     </p>

                  </figure>

                  <p>  Semen  with  volumes <1ml  or  >6mls  per  ejaculate,  density <15 million/ml or  >250 million/ml,  poor  motility  and  morphology  may  be  incompatible  with  normal  fertility.</p>
                </div>

                <h4>Hormonal  Evaluation</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>    Routine  evaluation  of  hormonal  parameter  is  not  necessary  unless  sperm  density  is  extremely  low  or  there  is  clinical  suspicion  of  an  endocrinopathy.  </li>
                    <li>The  incidence  of  primary  endocrine  defects  in  infertile  men  is  less  than  30%.  Such  defects  are  rare  in  men  with  a  sperm  concentration  of  >5 million/ml.  </li>
                    <li>When  an  endocrinopathy  is  discovered,  specific  hormonal  therapy  is  often  successful.  Follicle Stimulating Hormone(FSH),  Luteinizing Hormone(LH),  Testosterone  and  Prolactin  levels  are  checked  to  differentiate  hyper  or  hypogonadism,  primary  and  secondary  testicular  failure  as  well  as  obstructive  lesions.  </li>
                    <li>In  men  with  a  history  of  precocious  puberty,  one  should  consider  Congenital  adrenal  hyperplasia (CAH),  hence  serum  levels  of  17-OH  progesterone  are  evaluated.  Other  pituitary  hormones  like  ACTH,  TSH  and  GH  could  be  assessed  but  this  is  rarely  necessary.</li>
                   
                </ul>
                <h4>Chromosomal  studies</h4>
                <ul>
                  <li>    Chromosomal  studies  may  be  specially  indicated  in  men  with  small  testes,  azoospermia  and  elevated  FSH  levels  to  look  for  both  autosomal  and  sex  chromosomal  abnormalities.  </li>
                </ul>

                <h4>Antisperm  antibodies</h4>
                <ul>
                  <li>Antisperm  antibodies,  though  not  an  absolute  cause  of  infertility,  may  reduce  the  likelihood  of  pregnancy.</li>
                    <li>These  antibodies  may  impair  sperm  function  by  attaching  to  the  plasma  membrane  of  the  spermatozoa,  encouraging  sperm  agglutination  particularly  in  the  presence  of  infections.  Antisperm  antibodies  should  be  suspected  in  couples  who  persistently  have  abnormal  post-coital  tests.  Immunological  factor  may  be  responsible  for  up  to  20%  of  unexplained  infertility.</li>
                </ul>
                <h4>Special  Sperm  Function  Tests</h4>
                <ol>
                    <li>Sperm-cervical mucus interaction (post-coital test, PCT)</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>     This  test  assesses  the  ability  of  sperm  to  penetrate  and  progress  through  the  cervical  mucus.  Cervical  mucus  is  examined  2-8 hours  after  intercourse  at  the  time  of  expected  ovulation.  </li>
                        <li>The  presence  of  greater  than  10-20  motile  sperms  per  high  power  field  is  generally  accepted  as  a  normal  PCT.</li>
                        <li>    PCT  is  a  bioassay  that  provides  information  concerning  sexual  function,  sperm  motility  and  sperm-mucus  interaction.  A  positive  result  implies  normal  semen  and  mucus.  </li>
                        <li>A  poor  result  in  an  individual  with  normal  semen  parameters  implies  either  cervical  abnormalities  or  the  presence  of  sperm  antibodies.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <li>Sperm  Penetration  Assays.</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>    Penetration  of  an  oocyte  requires  sperm  capacitation,  acrosome  reaction,  fusion  and  incorporation  into  the  oocyte.  Cross-species  fertilization  is  normally  prevented  by  the  zona  pellucida.  </li>
                        <li>Hamster  eggs  stripped  of  the  zona  pellucida  can  be  penetrated  by  human  sperm.  This  in-vitro  functional  test  measures  the  penetration  ability  of  the  sperm.  </li>
                        <li>The  end  point  of  this  assay  is  penetration  of  the  ovum  and  decondensation  of  sperm  heads.  The  percentage  of  oocytes  penetrated  and  the  number  of  sperm  penetrating  each  oocyte  are  measured.  Sperm  that  are  capable  of  multiple  penetrations  per  oocyte  appear  to  have  greater  fertilizing  potential  than  sperm  that  do  not  penetrate.  </li>
                        <li>The  result  of  the  sperm  penetration  assay (SPA)  have  primarily  been  used  to  predict  the  results  of  assisted  reproductive  technique,  in  particular,  in-vitro  fertilization.</li>
                        <li>    Men  with  sperm  of  low  SPA  score  are  less  likely  to  achieve  a  spontaneous  pregnancy  than  those  with  a  high  SPA  score.  However,  abnormal  penetration  does  not  indicate  that  fertilization  cannot  occur,  nor  does  good  penetration  assure  fertilization.  </li>
                        <li>Generally  speaking,  less  than  10%  penetration  is  evidence  of  sperm  dysfunction  and  male  infertility.  Although  the  SPA  is  a  reliable  indicator  of  the  fertilizing  capacity  of  human  spermatozoa,  it  does  not  predict  the  ability  of  sperm  to  bind  to  and  penetrate  zona  pellucida  or  the  spermâ€™s  motility  and  progression  in  the  female  reproductive  tract.</li>
                    </ul>
                </ol>

                <h4>Tests  Of  Ovulation</h4>
                <p>The  regularity  of  a  menstrual  cycle  does  not  confirm  occurrence  of  ovulation,  though  most  women  who  have  regular  cycles  tended  to  ovulate  regularly.  </p>
                <p>Tests  of  ovulation  are  numerous  including  </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Basal Body Temperature(BBT),  </li>
                    <li>Endometrial  biopsy,  </li>
                    <li>Hormonal  Assay,  </li>
                    <li>Serial  ultrasound  folliculography,  </li>
                    <li>Cervical  mucus  and  vaginal  cytological  changes.  </li>
                </ul>
                <p>However,  the  only  confirmatory  evidence  of  ovulation  is  pregnancy  or  observation  of  the  corpus  luteum  during  laparascopy. </p>

                <ol>
                    <li>Basal  Body  Temperature.</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>    In  this  environment,  BBT  is  usually  reserved  for  literate  and  well  motivated  patients.  </li>
                        <li>Temperatures  should  be  taken  at  the  same  time  each  day  and  by  the  same  route,  preferably  just  after  rising  from  sleep  each  morning  taken  either  by  axillary  method  or  oral  route.  </li>
                        <li>A  BBT  chart  is  kept  on  daily  basis  and  a  biphasic  pattern  suggests  that  ovulation  had  occurred.  </li>
                        <li>In  ovulatory  cycles,  the  elevated  temperatures  post-ovulatory  is  brought  about  by  the  thermogenic  effect  of  progesterone  as  opposed  to  monophasic  temperature  pattern  in  anovulatory  cycles.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <li>Endometrial  Biopsy.</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>    Endometrial  biopsy  is  commonly  used  to  determine  the  occurrence  of  ovulation.  </li>
                        <li>A  histological  examination  of  an  endometrial  sampling  on  day  21  or  23  of  the  menstrual  cycle  will  show  secretory  endometrium  in  ovulatory  cycles  compatible  with  the  day  of  endometrial  sampling  while  simple  hyperplasia  or  atrophic  changes  will  be  seen  in  anovulation.  </li>
                        <li>An  added  advantage  of  this  method  is  that  it  also  permits  the  diagnosis  of  tuberculous  endometritis  and  luteal  phase  deficiency.  Inadequate  or  improper  endometrial  sampling  could  lead  to  errors  in  reporting.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <li>Hormone  Assays.</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>    Serum  progesterone  assay  using  radioimmunoassay  technique  measures  progesterone  levels  on  day  21  or  a  progesterone  index (mean  value  of  days  20,21,22  samples).  </li>
                        <li>There  is  inter-laboratory  variations  but  values  less  than  10 mmols/l  are  unsatisfactory.  Low  levels (< 5mmols/l)  will  suggest  anovulation  while  values  between  5-10mmols/l  may  suggest  luteal  phase  defect.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <li>Serial  Ultrasound  Folliculography        </li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>    This  has  now  been  made  easier  with  the  use  of  sector  scanner  and  a  vaginal  probe.  </li>
                        <li>Serially,  the  ovaries  are  scanned  from  the  beginning  of  the  menstrual  cycle  when  the  follicles  measure  on  an  average  3-5mm  to  the  peri-ovulatory  period  where  diameters  of  up  to  20-23mm  could  be  obtained.  </li>
                        <li>Usually  a  dominant  follicular  diameter  of  >16mm  is  highly  suggestive  that  ovulation  will  occur.  </li>
                        <li>Following  ovulation,  the  follicular  diameter  will  diminish  due  to  the  discharge  of  its  contents  and  eventual  transformation  into  a  corpus  luteum.  </li>
                        <li>Serial  ultrasound  folliculography  is  extremely  useful  in  monitoring  ovulation  during  induction  of  ovulation  and  assisted  reproductive  techniques.</li>

                    <li>    Cervical  mucus  and  vaginal  cytological  changes</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>They are  not  routinely  used  in  clinical  practice  in  our  environment.</li>
                        <li>However,  a  semi-quantitative  estimation  of  four  parameters â€“ the  amount  of  cervical  mucus,  spinnbarkeit (threadability),  crystallization  capacity  of  the  mucus  and  the  degree  of  opening  of  the  external  os  corresponds  well  with  the  hormonal  interplay  during  the  index  menstrual  cycle.  </li>
                        <li>Each  of  the  parameters  may  receive  a  score  of  0-3  points  with  the  total  score  being  0-12  points.  </li>
                        <li>    Since  the  amount  and  type  of  mucus  produced  by  the  endocervical  mucosa  are  under  hormonal  control,  the  cervical  score  is  an  indirect  indicator  of  relative  levels  of  estrogen  and  progesterone.  </li>
                        <li>Estrogen  stimulation  results  in  a  high  score  while  progesterone  results  in  a  low  cervical  score.  </li>
                        <li>A  low  cervical  score  indicates  either  lack  of  estrogen  or  a  high  progesterone  level  and  a  high  score (>8 points)  indicates  distinct  estrogen  stimulation  unopposed  by  progesterone  action.  </li>
                        <li>During  a  normal  ovulatory  cycle,  the  cervical  score  is  low  at  the  beginning,  becomes  positive  5-7  days  before  the  temperature  nadir,  increases  steadily  during  the  pre-ovulatory  period  reaching  a  high  plateau  within  2-3  days  of  ovulation,  declines  1-3  days  following  the  temperature  nadir,  and  becomes  negative  5  days  after  ovulation.   </li>
                        <li>    Vaginal  cytology  can  also  be  used  to  monitor  ovulation  period.  Local  inflammation,  douching  and  insertion  of  foreign  bodies  can  alter  the  results  obtained.  </li>
                        <li>The  presence  of  multilayered  navicular  cells  with  interstitial  oedema  in  the  vaginal  cytology  smear  may  suggest  progesterone  dominance  following  ovulation.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h4>Tests  Of  Tubal  Patency</h4>
                    <p>    Several  tubal  patency  tests  exist  involving  insufflation  with  air,  water  or  carbondioxide.  These  are  simple,  cheap  and  easy  to  perform  but  it  has  been  shown  that  these  methods  are  grossly  inadequate,  and  the  WHO  recommend  that  they  should  be  abandoned  even  as  a  screening  procedure.</p>
                    <p>    Laparascopy  plus  dye  hydrotubation  is  regarded  as  the  â€˜gold  standardâ€™  for  the  assessment  of  tubal  patency.  Moreover,  this  procedure  may  disclose  other  unsuspected  infertility  factors  such  as  endometriosis  and  pelvic  adhesions.  However,  laparascopy  requires  hospital  admission,  anaesthesia  and  a  fully  equipped  operating  room.  </p>
                    <p>Hysterosalpingography (HSG),  conversely,  remains  a  safe  and  simple  procedure  that  outlines  the  lumen  of  the  uterine  cavity  and  the  fallopian  tubes.  HSG  and  laparascopy  are  found  to  be  similar  in  80%  of  cases  with  a  similar  number  of  false  positives  and  false  negatives.  HSG  thus  remains  the  best  screening  test  in  our  environment.  The  ideal  technique,  however,  requires  a  television  fluoroscopy  monitor  which  is  not  readily  available  in  many  third  world  countries.  A  simplification  of  the  technique  was  found  in  a  plain  X-ray  of  the  pelvis  taken  15 minutes  after  the  injection  of  contrast  material  and  this  has  been  shown  to  have  a  good  correlation  with  the  findings  of  a  complete  HSG.</p>

                          <p>This  is  necessary  in  order  to  reduce  time  wastage  in  the  investigation  and  treatment  of  the  infertile  couple.  It  is  recommended  that  these  tests  could  be  completed  within  a  single  month  of  a  menstrual  cycle  and  the  results  provided  to  guide  treatment  during  the  next  menstrual  cycle.</p>
                          <p>    Following  the  initial  assessment  of  the  couple  in  the  day  preceding  the  onset  of  menses,  a  semen  analysis  could  be  ordered.  BBT  can  be  started  on  the  first  day  of  her  menses  while  Hysterosalpingogram (HSG)  can  be  done  between  days  7-11  and  a  PCT  on  day  14.  </p>
                          <p>Laparascopy  dye  test,  endometrial  biopsy  and  hormone  assays  could  be  performed  on  day  21.  The  results  of  these  tests  would  now  form  the  template  upon  which  further  assessment  and  treatment  would  be  based.</p>

                        <li>    Effective  treatment  for  the  infertile  or  subfertile  male  is  divisible  into  three  categories â€“ surgical,  medical  and  others.  </li>
                        <li>Surgical  treatment  aims  to  correct  specific  physical  defects  in  order  to  improve  sperm  quality.  Surgical  ligation  or  transvenous  embolization  has  been  used  to  improve  semen  parameters  in  selected  cases  of  varicocele. </li>
                        <li>Blockage  of  the  vas  deferens  or  epididymis  should  be  corrected  by  microsurgical  techniques  which  has  considerable  improved  pregnancy  rates  within  the  last  decade.  Pregnancy  rates  following  microsurgical  vasovasostomy  and  vasoepididymostomy  range  between  40-70%.</li>
                        <li>    Congenital  absence  of  vas  or  scarring  of  the  vas  deferens/epididymis  though  not  amenable  to  standard  surgical  correction,  is  best  handled  by  directly  aspirating  sperm  from  the  epididymal  tube  to  be  used  in  Zygote  Intrafallopian  Tube  Transfer (ZIFT).</li>
                        <li>    Infertile  men  with  hyperprolactinaemia  and  prolactinomas  respond  well  to  bromocryptine  while  gonadotrophin  are  useful  in  hypogonadotrophic  hypogonadism.  </li>
                        <li>Spermatogenesis  may  also  be  improved  by  medical  or  surgical  treatment  of  hyperthyroidism,  hypothyroidism,  cushingâ€™s  disease,  diabetes  mellitus  etc.</li>

                       <ol>
                        <li>Artificial  Insemination</li>
                        <p>    Artificial  insemination  may  be  performed  with  either  the  husbandâ€™s  sperm (AIH)  or  donor  sperm (AID).  Homologous  artificial  insemination  is  usually  reserved  for  specific  indications  such  as  male  impotence,  severe  hypospadias,  retrograde  ejaculation  or  abnormal  semen  parameters. </p>
                        <p>A  variation  of  artificial  insemination  with  the  husband  or  donor  semen  is  intrauterine  insemination  indicated  in  cases  of  cervical  factors  that  are  not  amenable  to  conventional  treatment  methods,  abnormal  PCT  of  undetermined  nature  and  certain  sperm  defects.</p>
                        <p>    It  is  preferred  now  to  use  frozen  semen (stored  for  at  least  6 months)  rather  than  fresh  semen  for  AID  in  view  of  the  risk  to  HIV  infection. </p>
                        <p>Haemoglobinopathy,  chlamydia  infection  etc  should  be  excluded  in  the  donor.  </p>
                        <p>Insemination  is  usually  performed  as  close  as  possible  to  the  time  of  ovulation.  In  intrauterine  insemination,  up  to  0.3-0.5mls  is  slowly  injected  through  the  intracervical  catheter,  the  rest  is  sprayed  over  the  cervical  mucus  or  placed  in  a  cervical  cap  which  may  be  left  in  place  for  few  hours.</p>
                        <p>    Artificial Insemination Homologous(AIH)  has  reported  pregnancy  rate  of  20-50%  while  for  AID,  the  value  is  between  40-50%  within  six  months  of  donor  insemination.  In  order  to  enhance  fertility  and  improve  pregnancy  rates  in  couples  with  unexplained  infertility,  superovulation  with  clomiphene  citrate  or  human  menopausal  gonadotrophin (HMG)  can  be  combined  with  intrauterine  insemination.</p>
                        <li>Assisted  Reproductive  Techniques(Art)</li>
                        <p>    These  techniques  can  be  used  to  treat  both  male  and  female  infertility  when  other  forms  of  treatment  has  failed  and  AID  is  unacceptable  to  the  couple.  </p>
                        <p>Asthenospermia  and  morphologic  abnormalities  hitherto  contraindications  to  ART    have  been  shown  to  be  capable  of  being  used  for  fertilization  successfully  in  ART.  </p>

                        <p>    Tubal  infertility  is  the  commonest  cause  of  secondary  infertility  in  women.  When  tubes  are  occluded,  macro  or  microsurgical  repair of  the  tubes  are  carried  out.  </p>
                        <p>The  various  restorative  tubal  surgeries  include  salpingolysis,  cuff  salpingostomy,  cornual  anastomosis(for  proximal  tubal  disease),  excision  and  end  to  end  anastomosis  and  tubal  implantation  into  the  uterus. </p>
                        <p>Despite  the  80-90%  tubal  patency  rate  obtained  in  many  centres,  pregnancy  rates  have  generally  varied  between  15-50%  due  to  a  variety  of  factors  amongst  which  are  </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Most  tubal  diseases  seen  in  Africa  are  in  advanced  stages  with  significant  pelvic  adhesions  </li>
                            <li>Limited  expertise  and  equipments  to  do  microtubal  surgery  </li>
                            <li>Significant  post-operative  adhesions  from  the  macrosurgical  technique  and  </li>
                            <li>A  patent  tube  does  not  necessarily  guarantee  a  functional  tube.  It  is  expected  that  with  improvements  in  surgical  techniques (especially  microtubal  surgical  techniques),  early  tubal  diseases  at  presentation,  prevention  of  post-operative  infection (including  STDs)  and  better  patient  selection,  improved  results  could  be  obtained.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>   Peritoneal  factors  such  as  pelvic  adhesions  arising  from  STDs,  Pelvic Inflammatory Diseases(PID),  endometriosis,  ruptured  viscera  etc  are  best  treated  with  adhesiolysis.  </p>
                        <p>The  best  results  are  obtained  in  those  with  mild  pelvic  adhesions  while  moderate-severe  pelvic  adhesions  may  infact  worsen  the  prognosis  for  the  woman.  </p>
                        <p>The  use  of  ventrosuspension  in  pelvic  surgery  for  infertility  is  recommended  to  reduce  postoperative  posterior  pelvic  adhesions.  Endometriosis  are  best  handled  with  a  combination  of  Danazol  and  adhesiolysis.</p>
                        <h4>Endocrinopathy</h4>
                        <p>    In  patients  with  anovulatory  disorders,  ovulation  could  be  induced  with  either  Clomiphene  citrate (Clomid)  tabs  or  Human  gonadotrophin  (HCG)  injections.  </p>
                        <p>It  is  necessary  to  initiate  Clomid  therapy  from  the  50mg  daily  scheduled  to  a  maximum  of  200-250mg  twice  daily  regimen.  If  after  6th  treatment  cycles,  the  patient  does  not  ovulate,  the  chances  are  that  the  patient  may  not.  </p>
                        <p>It  is  also  important  to  avoid  hyperstimulation  syndrome  in  such  women.  The  success  rate  with  Clomid  therapy  in  suitable  cases  have  been  estimated  to  be  between  80-85% 6.</p>
                        <p>    In  amenorrhoiec  women  with  normal  genital  apparatus,  menstruation  can  be  recalled  following  a  PCT  followed  by  Clomid  and  HCG  therapy.</p>
                        <p>Hypergonadotrophic  hypogonadism  associated  with  hyperprolactinaemia  is  treated  with  bromocryptine  to  restore  normal  cycles  and  ovulation.</p>

                        <p>    These  procedures  are  used  for  infertile  couples  who  cannot  get  pregnant  through  conventional  means.  Much  interest  has  been  generated  by  these  procedures  since  the  first  success  was  recorded  in  1978  by  Edwards  and  Steptoe  with  the  birth  of  Loius  Brown  through  IVF + ET.  Since  then,  other  procedures  have  been  introduced  namely-GIFT,  ZIFT,  Pronuclear  Stage  Tubal  Transfer (PROST),  ICSI  etc .  </p>
                        <p>These  procedures  are  now  a  part  of  the  procedures  to  manage  intractable  infertility  in  many  developed  countries.  The  specific  indications  for  the  procedures  include  irreversible  tubal  infertility,  severe  oligospermia  and  unexplained  infertility.</p>
                        <p>    At  present  the  success  rate  for  IVF+ET  and  GIFT  in  developed  countries  varies  from  20-35%  per  treatment  cycle.  However,  experience  from  developing  countries  including  Nigeria  has  not  been  encouraging  where  results  have  been  poorer.  </p>
                        <p>Some  of  the  factors  responsible  for  this  included </p>
                        <ul>
                         <li>High  cost  of  the  procedures,  </li>
                         <li>High  cost  of  setting  up  and  maintaining  these  centres,  </li>
                         <li>Skilled  expertise  may  not  be  readily  available  and  </li>
                         <li>Basic  infrastructural  facilities  which  complement  the  attainment  of  success  in  these  procedures  are  lacking.  </li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Also,  in  developing  countries,  these  procedures  are  not  cost-effective,  compete  with  basic  health  care  necessity  and  if  though  they  are  potentially  useful  for  up  to  10-15%  of  infertile  couples,  considerably  few  number  are  able  to  utilise  these  for  the  above-mentioned  reasons.</p>

                       <h4>Adoption</h4>
                       <ul>
                        <li>    Adoption  is  considered  an  option  for  those  couples  who  have  tried  without  success  in  infertility  management.  </li>
                        <li>In  African  societies,  like  in  many  other  traditional  societies,  adoption  is  still  considered  unacceptable  and  almost  a  taboo  in  some  societies.  </li>
                        <li>In  adoption,  adequate  legal  backing,  social  welfare  programmes,  proper  monitoring  needs  to  be  put  in  place  in  order  to  protect  the  interest  of  the  adoptee,  adopter  and  the  society  at  large.</li>
                       </ul>

                       <h4>Surrogate  Motherhood</h4>
                       <ul>
                        <li>    This  is  a  situation  in  which  an  infertile  woman  procures  the  services  of  a  fertile  woman  to  carry  a  pregnancy  for  her  using  the  infertile  woman  husbandâ€™s  sperm  for  fertilization.  Such  infertile  women  invariably  must  have  had  many  unsuccessful  attempts  at  infertility  management (both  conventional  and  ART).  </li>
                        <li>The  surrogate  mother  is  therefore  expected  to  carry  the  pregnancy  and  following  childbirth,  hands  over  the  newborn  to  the  infertile  woman -  in  other  words  her  uterus  was  hired  for  a  service.</li>
                        <li>    This  obviously  requires  considerably  legal  procedures,  psychological  counselling  and  perhaps  adequate  financial  compensation  to  prevent  the  problems  of  regrets  by  the  surrogate  mother.  </li>
                        <li>In  extreme  cases,  the  surrogate  mother  may  resort  to  murder  of  the  infertile  couple  and  the  baby.</li>
                       </ul>

                       <h4>Cloning</h4>
                       <ul>
                        <li>    This  is  a  controversial  option  that  may  be  open  to  an  infertile  woman  in  her  desperation  to  have  an  offspring.  </li>
                        <li>It  is  still  considered  to  be  at  experimental  stage  inspite  of  the  birth  of  Dolly-sheep.  It  is  expensive  and  still  illegal  in  most  parts  of  the  world  to  carry  out  research  on  human  cloning  because  of  ethical,  technical,  socio-cultural  and  religious  objections  to  this  procedures. </li>
                        <li> It  is  however  interesting  to  note  that  cloned  animals  have  been  shown  to  age  faster,  have  more  congenital  defects  and  have  more  auto-immune  disorders.</li>

           <p>    Most  of  the  causes  of  infertility,  particularly  secondary  infertility,  are  preventable.  In  Africa,  80-85%  of  infertile  couples  have  post-infective  causes.  </p>
           <p>Measures  aimed  at  preventing  pelvic  infections  in  Africa  include</p>
           <ol>
            <li>Reduction  in  incidence  of  stds  and  pids  </li>
            <li>Prevention  of  intrapartum  and  postpartum  infections  </li>
            <li>Prevention  of  post-abortal  sepsis.  </li>
           </ol>
           <p>Other  measures  suggested  include  a  more  proactive  abortion  law  for  the  country,  increased  use  of  contraceptive  to  reduce  or  prevent  unwanted  pregnancies,  improvement  in  the  womenâ€™s  status,  equality  of  right  to  education,  work  and  reproductive  health  decisions  and  affordable,  accessible  and  functional  antenatal  care  services  including  skilled  delivery.   </p>
