            <p>Right- based approach adopted as a universal policy consensus, at ICPD Cairo, 1994, representing a paradigm shift in emphasis from family planning and demography to the right of the individual. The Concept of Womenâ€™s Sexual and Reproductive Right (WSRR) emerged and became recognized as an integral aspect of universal human right. </p>
            <p>The rights-based approach to reproductive health includes:</p>
            <ul>

                <li>Building on the existing international human rights treaties. </li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Reproductive Rights: </h4>
            <p>This implies the right of couples to decide freely and responsibly on the number, timing, and spacing of their children and have the information, education and means to do so; attain the highest standards of reproductive health; and make decisions about reproduction free of discrimination, coercion and violence.</p>

            <h4>Sexual Right: </h4>
            <p>This implies the right of all people to decide freely and responsibly on all aspects of their sexuality; be free of discrimination, coercion and violence in their sexual lives and decisions; and expect and demand equality, full consent, mutual respect and shared responsibility in sexual relationships</p>

            <h4>Components of Womenâ€™s Sexual & Rep. Rights:</h4>
            <p>IPPF developed from 4 international human right treatise â€“ a set of concerns patterned after the universal human right, which became known as the component of women sexual and reproductive rights.</p>
            <p>These includes</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Right to Life.</li>
                <li>Right to liberty and security of the person.</li>

                <li>Right to privacy.</li>
                <li>Right to freedom of thought.</li>
                <li>Right to information and education.</li>
