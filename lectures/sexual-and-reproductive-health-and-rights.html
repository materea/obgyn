            <p>Right- based approach adopted as a universal policy consensus, at ICPD Cairo, 1994, representing a paradigm shift in emphasis from family planning and demography to the right of the individual. The Concept of Women’s Sexual and Reproductive Right (WSRR) emerged and became recognized as an integral aspect of universal human right. </p>
            <p>The rights-based approach to reproductive health includes:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Placing of the health and well-being of individuals at the center of programme policy design.</li>
                <li>Recognition of the importance of gender equity and equality, and</li>

            </ul>

            <h4>Reproductive Rights: </h4>
            <p>This implies the right of couples to decide freely and responsibly on the number, timing, and spacing of their children and have the information, education and means to do so; attain the highest standards of reproductive health; and make decisions about reproduction free of discrimination, coercion and violence.</p>

            <h4>Sexual Right: </h4>
            <p>This implies the right of all people to decide freely and responsibly on all aspects of their sexuality; be free of discrimination, coercion and violence in their sexual lives and decisions; and expect and demand equality, full consent, mutual respect and shared responsibility in sexual relationships</p>

            <h4>Components of Women’s Sexual & Rep. Rights:</h4>
            <p>IPPF developed from 4 international human right treatise – a set of concerns patterned after the universal human right, which became known as the component of women sexual and reproductive rights.</p>
            <p>These includes</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Right to Life.</li>
                <li>Right to liberty and security of the person.</li>

                <li>Right to privacy.</li>
                <li>Right to freedom of thought.</li>
                <li>Right to information and education.</li>
