            <p>The second most common endocrinologic disorders found in pregnancy are thyroid disorders. </p>
            <p>In the United State of America (USA), overt hypothyroidism is estimated to occur in 0.3-0.5% of pregnancies, while subclinical hypothyroidism appears to occur in 2-3%, and hyperthyroidism is present in 0.1-0.4%. </p>
            <p>Autoimmune thyroid dysfunctions remain a common cause of both hyperthyroidism and hypothyroidism in pregnant women. </p>
            <p>Gravesâ€™ disease accounts for more than 85% of all cases of hyperthyroid, whereas Hashimoto thyroiditis is the most common cause of hypothyroidism.</p>

            <p>Generally, symptoms of autoimmune thyroid diseases tend to improve during pregnancy.</p>
            <p>A postpartum exacerbation is not uncommon and perhaps occurs because of an alteration in the maternal immune system during pregnancy. </p>
            <p>The improvement in thyroid autoimmune diseases is thought to be due to the altered immune status in pregnancy.</p>
            <p>Postpartum thyroiditis (PPT) reportedly affects 4-10% of women. PPT is an autoimmune thyroid disease that occurs during the first year after delivery. Women with PPT present with transient thyrotoxicosis, hypothyroidism, or transient thyrotoxicosis followed by hypothyroidism. This presentation may be unrecognized, but is important because it predisposes the woman to develop permanent hypothyroidism. </p>
            <p>Women with a past history of treated Gravesâ€™ disease or a thyrotoxic phase in early pregnancy are at increased risk of developing (Graves) hyperthyroidism postpartum.</p>

            <p>The defect that predisposes an individual to develop autoimmune thyroid disease is still unknown. </p>
            <p>Proposed mechanisms include a tissue-specific defect in suppressor T-cell activity, a genetically programmed presentation of a thyroid-specific antigen, and an idiotype/anti-idiotype reaction.</p>
            <p>Regardless of the cause, the common outcome is the production of 1 or more types of autoantibodies, which affect thyroid function positively or negatively.</p>

                   <p>Graves disease is described as an autoimmune dysfunction of the thyroid gland. The sera of patients with Graves disease is thought to contain a factor that stimulated the murine thyroid gland. This factor had a longer duration of action than that of thyrotropin (i.e. thyroid-stimulating hormone [TSH]), the long-acting thyroid stimulator. </p>
                   <p>Further studies revealed that these long-acting thyroid stimulators are autoantibodies directed against the TSH receptor. The activating versions of the TSH receptor are the thyroid-stimulating autoantibodies, which activate adenylate cyclase and which stimulate thyroid function.</p>
                   <p>In terms of histologic features, the thyroid glands of patients with Graves disease show follicular hypertrophy and hyperplasia.</p>

                   <p>PPT has 3 phases:</p>
                   <ol>
                    <li>Hyperthyroid phase, when thyroid hormones are being released because of thyroid destruction</li>
                    <li>Hypothyroid phase</li>
                    <li>Resolution, or euthyroid, phase</li>
                   </ol>
                   <p>The most common time for women present with PPT is 1-8 months after delivery, with a peak incidence at 6 months. This timing is important because the process may overlap with the next pregnancy in women who have short pregnancy intervals.</p>
                   <p>Depending on the stage of disease at the time of presentation, patients may have symptoms of hyperthyroid or hypothyroid, as outlined above.</p>

                   <p>This condition is characterized by elevated FT4 values, suppressed TSH levels, minimal thyroid enlargement, variable evidence of clinical hyperthyroidism, and absent thyroid antibodies. </p>
                   <p>Gestational hyperthyroidism is due to the thyroid-stimulation effects of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) and is most likely to arise in the setting of elevated hCG concentrations (e.g., molar or multiple pregnancies). Treatment is usually not needed because spontaneous recovery occurs after the first trimester.</p>

                   <h4>T3, T4, FT3, FT4, and TSH tests</h4>
                   <ul>
                    <li>Total T3 and total T4 levels are increased due to a rise in the amount of thyroid-binding globulin. Free T3 (FT3) and FT4 levels are high-normal in the first trimester and return to normal by the second trimester.</li>
                    <li>Total T4 values are not useful in pregnant women because they rise in response to the estrogen-induced increase in the amount of thyroid-binding globulin.</li>
                    <li>FT3 values should be measured when the TSH value is suppressed but the FT4 level is normal. An elevated T3 level confirms T3 toxicosis, an early stage in the development of true hyperthyroidism.</li>
                    <li>TSH concentrations fall during pregnancy, especially in the first trimester, because hCG cross-reacts with TSH receptors on the thyroid gland.</li>
                    <li>Resin T3 update test: Resin T3 uptake is reduced because the number of unsaturated binding sites increases.</li>
                    <li>Test for thyroid-stimulating immunoglobulins (TSIs), CBC, liver function test, and determination of calcium and magnesium levels and Anti-microsomal antibody test. </li>

                   <p>Definitions of hypothyroidism and subclinical hypothyroidism in pregnancy:</p>
                   <ul>
                    <li>In primary hypothyroidism, TSH levels are elevated and the FT4 value or FT4 index should be low.</li>
                    <li>With supra-thyroid hypothyroidism, the TSH level may be normal or low, and the FT4 level or FT4 index is low.</li>
                    <li>In subclinical hypothyroidism, the FT4 value is normal, and the TSH level is elevated.</li>
                   </ul>
                   <p>Elevations in serum TSH during pregnancy should be defined using pregnancy-specific reference ranges.</p>
                   <p>Hypothyroidism is defined as an elevated TSH (>2.5 mIU/L) in conjunction with a decreased FT4 concentration.</p>
                   <p>Women with TSH levels of 10.0 mIU/L or above, regardless of their FT4 levels, are also considered to have hypothyroidism. </p>
                   <p>Subclinical hypothyroidism is defined as a serum TSH between 2.5 and 10 mIU/L with a normal FT4 concentration.</p>
                   <p>Isolated hypothyroxinemia is defined as a normal maternal TSH concentration in conjunction with FT4 concentrations in the lower 5th or 10th percentile of the reference range. </p>
                   <h4>Other tests for Hypothyroidism</h4>
                   <ul>
                    <li>Tests for anti-TPO and antithyroglobulin antibodies</li>
                    <li>Levels of anti-TPO and antithyroglobulin antibodies should be measured in pregnant women with possible hypothyroidism to determine if Hashimoto thyroiditis is the cause.</li>
                    <li>Measurement of anti-TPO antibody concentrations is often sufficient because the results are almost always positive in patients with Hashimoto thyroiditis.</li>
                    <li>CBC and liver function tests</li>
                    <li>Consider ordering a CBC and liver function tests after hypothyroidism is diagnosed.</li>
                    <li>Anemia is observed in as many as 30-40% of patients because erythropoiesis is decreased.</li>
                    <li>Concomitant vitamin B-12 or folic acid deficiency should be considered if the anemia is macrocytic.</li>
                    <li>Leukocyte and platelet counts are usually normal.</li>

                <h4>Prenatal counseling and management of Graves disease</h4>
               <p>Women with hyperthyroidism should be treated either with ablative therapy (iodine radiation or surgery) or medical therapy and become euthyroid before attempting pregnancy. For ablative therapy, TSI titers tend to increase and remain elevated for many months. </p>
               <p>A pregnancy test should be performed 48 hours before the iodine radiation ablation to avoid radiation exposure to the fetus. Conception should be delayed for 6 months post-ablation to allow time for the dose of T4 to be adjusted to obtain target values for pregnancy (serum TSH between 0.3 and 2.5 mIU/L).</p>
               <p>If the patient chooses thioamide drugs (ATD therapy), propylthiouracil (PTU) should be used in the first trimester of pregnancy, because of the risk of methimazole (MMI) embryopathy; and consideration should be given to discontinuing PTU after the first trimester and switching to MMI in order to decrease the incidence of liver disease. Contraception should be used until normal thyroid function is achieved.  </p>
               <h4>Pregnancy management</h4>
               <p>The goal of treatment is to maintain clinical euthyroidism, with the mother's FT4 level in the high-normal range.</p>
               <p>In order to prevent overtreatment and possible neonatal hypothyroidism, the lowest dose possible should be used to keep maternal free T4 and free T3 in upper limit of the normal range.</p>
               <p>Thioamide drugs (i.e., ATDs) are the first-line treatment in pregnancy. PTU, methimazole (MMI), and carbimazole (CMI) are the ATDs available in the United States. These drugs inhibit iodination of thyroglobulin and thyroglobulin synthesis by competing with iodine for the enzyme peroxidase. PTU, MMI, and CMI are equally effective.</p>
               <p>Beta-blockers (e.g., atenolol, nadolol, propranolol) are valuable adjuncts to ATDs. These drugs effectively alleviate symptoms of hypermetabolic states. With prolonged use, beta-blockers are associated with foetal morbidity. Therefore, these drugs should be used for only a short period (i.e., 2 wk.) while one waits for the ATDs to take effect.</p>
               <p>Use of radioactive iodine is contraindicated in pregnancy.</p>

               <p>The goal of treatment is to normalize maternal TSH levels. (It should be remembered that iodine deficiency is an important cause of neonatal neurologic damage worldwide). </p>
               <p>The recommended mean intake of iodine during pregnancy and lactation is approximately 250 mcg/d.</p>
               <p>Thyroid hormone replacement using synthetic thyroxine (T4) is the treatment for patients with hypothyroidism, which should be corrected before pregnancy occurs. </p>
               <p>A full replacement dosage of 1.6-2.0 mcg/kg/day should be started at the time of diagnosis. Preconception thyroid medication should be adjusted to achieve a TSH level of less than 2.5 mU/mL before pregnancy. </p>
               <p>Other thyroid preparations, such as T3 or desiccated thyroid, are strongly discouraged. The goal of thyroid hormone treatment is to normalize maternal serum TSH values within the trimester-specific pregnancy reference range (first trimester, 0.1-2.5 mIU/L; second trimester, 0.2-3.0 mIU/L; third trimester, 0.3-3.0 mIU/L).</p>

                    <p>The outcome of pregnancies affected by autoimmune thyroid disease depends on the degree of metabolic control. Women with euthyroid disease can expect satisfactory outcomes of their pregnancy. With close follow-up postpartum, medical therapy can be adjusted to ensure a euthyroid state. This helps ensure a good prognosis.</p>
