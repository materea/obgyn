              <h4>Intervention</h4>
              <p>
                During the last two decades, child survival in developing countries has been given a prominent place in the world agenda. The realization that of 20 million children born each year in Africa, 4 million will die before their 5th birthday has led to the child survival initiative project.

            <p><strong>Child Survival Strategies (CSS)</strong> was a brain child of the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) following the Alma-Ata declaration in 1978.</p>
            <p>These strategies comprise <em>low-cost technologies</em> believed to be affordable to nations, communities, and individuals.</p>
            <p>The primary aim of these technologies is to <em>reduce childhood mortalities</em>, which are most prevalent in the developing world.</p>
            <p><strong>CSS</strong> was established as a means of promoting <em>accelerated and sustained action</em> towards achieving Millennium Development Goal 4 (MDG4).</p>
            
            <p><strong>CSS</strong> followed a process&hellip;</p>
            <p><em>Core versus Non-Core</em></p>
            <p><strong>1st Strategy: Growth Monitoring, Oral Rehydration, Breastfeeding, and Immunization (GOBI)</strong></p>
            <p><strong>2nd Strategy: GOBI plus Female Education, Family Planning, Food Supplementation, and Follow-up (GOBI plus FFFF)</strong></p>
            <p><strong>3rd Strategy: GOBIFFFF plus Essential Care for Every Newborn, Training in Home Management of Fever, and Hygiene (GOBIFFFF plus EETH)</strong></p>
            
            <p>With time, other low-cost technologies were added. These components are:</p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Female education</strong></li>
              <li><strong>Family planning</strong></li>
              <li><strong>Food supplementation</strong></li>
              <li><strong>Follow-up</strong></li>
            </ul>
            <p>The acronym then became <strong>GOBIFFF</strong>.</p>
            
            <p>These strategies have further been enlarged to include several other Primary Health Care (PHC) activities such as:</p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Environmental Protection and Adequate Sanitation</strong></li>
              <li><strong>Essential Drugs Programme</strong></li>
              <li><strong>Treatment of Common Diseases</strong></li>
              <li><strong>Health Education</strong></li>
            </ul>
            <p>The acronym now stands as <strong>GOBIFFFFEETH</strong>.</p>

            <p><em>Growth Monitoring</em> involves regularly measuring a child's size to document their growth.</p>
            <p>The child's measurements are then plotted on a growth chart, which is crucial for detecting early changes in their growth patterns.</p>
            <p>Abnormal growth rates—either too slow or too fast—may indicate underlying nutritional or health issues.</p>
            <p><strong>Growth Monitoring</strong> is an integral component of primary health care.</p>
            <p>It serves as an early warning mechanism, as the detection of growth faltering allows for timely and appropriate nutritional intervention.</p>
            <p>Encouraging mothers' participation in weighing their children and offering rewards to mothers of children on the path to health can further enhance the effectiveness of growth monitoring efforts.</p>

              <li>Practice rooming-in, allow mother and infant to remain together 24 hours a day.</li>
              <li>Encourage breastfeeding on demand.</li>

            <p>The possibility that children will become seriously ill or die depends largely on whether their immune systems can fight off infections. Malnutrition, combined with unsanitary or crowded conditions, makes them extremely vulnerable. For instance, measles rarely kills in industrialized countries but can cause up to 40% mortality among infected children in dire and overcrowded situations.</p>
            
            <ul>
              <li>A two-way relationship between health and nutrition is recognized. Sicknesses increase the possibility of malnutrition and vice-versa.</li>
              <li>Exclusive breastfeeding must be followed by appropriate and adequate complementary diet. Complementary foods that are locally produced can be conveniently and hygienically prepared and at the same time provide optimal nutrient content.</li>
              <li>Prevention of food-borne diarrhea by promoting proper feeding practices, food hygiene, and selection of nutrient-dense locally available foods will facilitate the control of the problem of malnutrition.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <blockquote>
              <p>“Vaccination is widely recognized as one of the most powerful and cost-effective public health tools. Often immunization is a child’s first – sometimes only – contact with the health system.” – Carol Bellamy, Former Executive Director UNICEF.</p>

            <ul>
              <li>Immunization is essential to save children’s lives.</li>
              <li>It is also an affordable means of protecting whole communities (herd immunity).</li>
              <li>Immunization has saved over 20 million lives in the last two decades.</li>
              <li>Immunization rate for major vaccine preventable diseases (VPD) has risen from 10% in 1970 to &gt; 80% today. Deaths from measles have declined by over 2/3 in the last decade.</li>
              <li>Immunization aims at reducing morbidity and mortality from VPD.</li>
